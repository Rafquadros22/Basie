            The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and
            North
            America. It is the largest extant member of Canidae, with males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg
            (82
            lb).On average, wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height.
            The wolf
            isalso distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter
            torso and
            alonger tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote
            and the
            golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white,
            brown,
            gray,and black. Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog.

            Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated
            by
            its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive
            behaviour. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring.
            Offspring
            may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition within the pack
            for
            food. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf
            mortality.
            The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds primarily on large wild hooved mammals, though it also eats smaller
            animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates
            in
            hunting than do large packs. Various pathogens and parasites may infect wolves, notably rabies.
